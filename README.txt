Project Info:

     This is a Gooogle App Engine Project that utilizes many database features and 
     intuitive UI. This project was made to serve as an informational database for 
     world crises and connects different world crises along with the people and 
     organizations that were involved in these crises. This project is a good example
     to display the amount of teamwork needed to be successful in a project of this
     magnitude. Documentation for this project is in the docs/index.html. 
     
     To run the App, simply follow the link below.
